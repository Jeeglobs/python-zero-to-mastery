In fields of green, where sunshine gleams,
A loyal friend with wagging dreams,
Through meadows vast, their spirits soar,
A canine tale forevermore.

With gentle eyes and hearts so pure,
Their love and warmth, a treasure sure,
Through playful bounds and joyful leaps,
A bond so strong, forever keeps.

In every bark and happy yelp,
Their joyful spirit, heartfelt help,
Through wagging tails and endless joy,
A faithful friend who will not coy.
