In fields of green, where sunshine gleams,
A loyal friend with wagging dreams,
Through meadows vast, their spirits soar,
A canine tale forevermore.

With gentle eyes and hearts so pure,
Their love and warmth, a treasure sure,
Through playful bounds and joyful leaps,
A bond so strong, forever keeps.

In every bark and happy yelp,
Their joyful spirit, heartfelt help,
Through wagging tails and endless joy,
A faithful friend who will not coy.

From tiny pups with paws so small,
To aging dogs, their spirits tall,
They teach us love and loyalty,
With every sniff and wag they see.

They chase their tails with playful glee,
An endless source of jubilee,
Through boundless zest, they live each day,
In doggie dreams, they romp and play.

They guide the blind with tender care,
A canine heart that's always there,
Through service true, their purpose shines,
In noble ways, they read the signs.

In gardens blooming, they explore,
Their paws in dirt, forevermore,
Through scents they trace and trails they find,
A canine world, forever kind.

From fluffy coats to shiny sheen,
In every breed, a sight to glean,
Through snowy paths or sandy shores,
A pawprint trail, forever roars.

They curl beside us, warm and tight,
A comfort through the darkest night,
Through loyalty and love so pure,
A bond that's everlasting, sure.

In laughter shared and tears consoled,
A faithful heart that can't be sold,
Through years of friendship, tried and true,
A canine's love, forever grew.

So here's to dogs, both big and small,
Their spirits boundless, hearts enthral,
Through playful bounds and wagging tails,
A dog's love never, ever fails.
