4 PILLARS OF OOP:
    * encapsulation
    * abstraction
    * inheritance
    * polymorphism


everything in python inherits from the base object class


OBJECT INSTROPECTION:
    * the ability to determine the type of an object at runtime (when the code is running)


DUNDER METHODS:
    * usually do not want to change them, but you can


In Pure Functions:
    * should not produce any side affects
    * an imput should always return the same output
